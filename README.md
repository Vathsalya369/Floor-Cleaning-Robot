# Floor-Cleaning-Robot
This project's purpose is to design, develop, and test the performance of a floor cleaning robot that can clean diverse indoor floor surfaces on its own, achieving dry and wet cleaning in a single run.So we keep a hoover to suck dust from the floor and it is connected to a motor driver with a 9v battery, and then using a waterpump, water can be poured on the floor whose inputs are connected to the same motordriver, and simultaneously mopping can be done whose inputs are connected to the another motordriver, and for vehicle movement, we keep two wheels attached to dc motors and their inputs are connected to a motordriver with a 9v battery and all these motordrivers are connected to arduino uno.The code was written in Embedded C and dumped onto an Arduino uno.We utilise a bluetooth module to connect and operate the robot with a mobile phone via the RC Bluetooth Controller app, and we offer inputs via the mobile phone and the robot moves accordingly.
